add option to use reference cell in parallel.
add option to measure reference cell only at the beginning (mostly for other systems) - switch between front and back on 2400 to switch from sample to photodiode.
datafile: 
JV: Voltage, corrected cell current, measured cell current, measured light intensity
use single correction factor for average light intensity when calculating corrected cell current.  also add average measured light intensity in header.
when calculating metrics, use JV curve with single-point correction.

display current light intensity in a field on the gui during the scan.

contant-voltage: do a live correction for the measured light intensity.  start with a few-second average measurement to determine the actual light intensity.  normalize the rest of the scan to the initial measured value.  use this initial value for the corrected data in the data file.  also include raw current and light intensity in data file

constant-current: measure light intensity at the beginning as with previous but do no data correction afterwards.

MPP: measure light intensity at the beginning.  correct measured current to this value.  use corrected current to calculate power.  report raw current and measured light intensity in data file.
